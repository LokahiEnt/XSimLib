# XSimLib
A reference implementation in C#/.NET/Mono for generating simulated data by parsing a radiological exercise scenario file encoded as per the XSim XML standard. Once the library is initialized with an exercise scenario and locale it will generate simulated instrument readings, inject events, and simulated weather notification events when provided with a latitude, longitude, altitude in the WGS84 world geodetic system and GPS based time. Depending on the exercise scenario GUI's for simulated instruments, spectral or scalar data, locale specific names/units may be available.
